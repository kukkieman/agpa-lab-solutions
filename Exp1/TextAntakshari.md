Program will input word from user and check it in checker-dict.txt. If word is present, it will be removed from the checker-dict.txt file and the computer will output a word (present and vaid in the dictionary) that begins with the last letter of the user's input word. For every valid word entered, respective points should be incremented by one. If a word is not valid, game ends and the winner is the one with the highest points.
